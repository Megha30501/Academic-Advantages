# Academic-Advantage
My project, Academic Advantage, is designed to help students by providing information about available Teaching Assistants (TA's). The Student Support Center at our university manages all the data and details of the TA's, and some of them even teach students at times. However, it may not be clear where to find this information.
To address this, I created a React application where students can view information about the TA's, including their availability and location. This information will be useful for students who need instant Zoom help or who want to connect with TA's at the Student Support Center.

1. What functionality is present?
**Menu**: There is a menu with two options in my application; one of them is Home and the other is Add TA.

**All the TAs are Listed**: When my application goes live, you can see a main home page with a list of all the TAs along with some information. 
                      -> The information includes the course name, course code, TA name, availability day(s), and availability time(s).

**TA Form**: There's TA page in my application where one can Add new TA with information.

**Data Click ability**: Since you can see TA information on the Home page, that data is clickable. When you click on the course name, you will be sent to a different page where you can see all of the TAs who are the TAs of that course. likewise if you click on the TA's name, you will be taken to a different page where you can view all of the other information, including the instructor of the course, their availability times, and a Zoom link if applicable.

**Filter**: There is a search box on the homepage where you can type whatever you want to look up. For instance, if you want to look up a specific course in which you are interested but the large amount of details on the homepage prevented you from doing so, you can type the course name and the data will be filtered.

**Sort By **: There's Sort by option available on home page, which sorts the data in either ascending or descending order. That way you can see data more clearly.

**User Views**: There are three users in total. TA, Super Admin, and regular user. As a result, the application always runs in normal user mode. However, if you choose to log in as a Super User, you have more authority than a regular user, such as the ability to delete the TA's details. If you are logged in as a TA, you can set your status as "super busy" or "completely available." Therefore, when regular user sees this status, they can learn whether the TA is available or not.
